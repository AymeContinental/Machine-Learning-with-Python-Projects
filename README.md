# 🧠 Machine Learning Projects  

Five projects for the **Machine Learning with Python** certification from **freeCodeCamp**.  
A collection of practical **Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects** developed with **Python**, **TensorFlow**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Google Colab**.  
Each notebook is self-contained, includes a description, and demonstrates a different ML concept — from image classification to text prediction.

## 📚 Projects Overview

### 🐱🐶 Cats vs Dogs Image Classifier  
A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** that classifies images as either **cats or dogs** using TensorFlow and Keras.  
- **Goal:** Achieve at least 63% accuracy (70%+ for extra credit)  
- **Tech:** `ImageDataGenerator`, `Conv2D`, `MaxPooling2D`, `Dense`, `ReLU`, `sigmoid`  
- **Result:** 70–80% accuracy achieved with data augmentation  
- **File:** `cats_dogs_classifier.ipynb`

### 📖 Book Recommendation Engine (KNN)  
A **book recommender system** built with the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm.  
- **Dataset:** Book-Crossing dataset (1.1M ratings, 270K books, 90K users)  
- **Goal:** Recommend 5 similar books for a given title  
- **Tech:** `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `NearestNeighbors`, `cosine distance`  
- **File:** `book_recommender_knn.ipynb`
